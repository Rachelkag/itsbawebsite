          Coronaviruses are a family of viruses known for containing strains that cause potentially deadly diseases in
          mammals and birds. Of the seven coronaviruses kown to infect humans, four spread with seasonal regularity,
          causing anything from mild cold-like symptoms to flu-like discomforts. A few more notable strains, including
          SARS-CoV-2 (responsible for COVID-19), and those responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and
          Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), can cause death in humans. The cause of death is complex, though is
          typically the result of heightened immune responses causing damage in multiple systems throughout the body.

      <h1>How is the virus spread?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough,
          sneeze, speak, sing or breathe heavily. These liquid particles are different sizes, ranging from larger
          ‘respiratory droplets’ to smaller ‘aerosols’
        </p>
        <p>
          The virus can also be transmitted from person to person when droplets form an infected person's mouth gets
          into an uninfected person's mouth, nose or eyes, which is more likely to happen when people are in direct or
          close contact (less than 1 metre apart) with an infected person
        </p>
        <p>
          The virus can also spread after infected people sneeze, cough on, or touch surfaces, or objects, such as
          tables, doorknobs and handrails. Other people may become infected by touching these contaminated surfaces,
          then touching their eyes, noses or mouths without having cleaned their hands first.
